Tests for an  interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that  interface.  After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult  can be read to determine the outcome.  If an agent can not  perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate.  The  object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test-  specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific)  information concerning the outcome of the test.  Only one  test can be in progress on each interface at any one time.  If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the  second test is rejected.  Some agents may reject a test when  a prior test is active on another interface.   Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain  'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the  interface to be tested.  This is accomplished with the  ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows: try_again:    get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus)    while (ifTestStatus != notInUse)   /*    * Loop while a test is running or some other    * manager is configuring a test.    */   short delay   get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus)    }     /*     * Is not being used right now",
